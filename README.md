 This Is a Websit which is designed to manage Internal Marks Of Students in  an organization

This project is entitled as "Student Internal Assessment Marks Management System". The 
main aim of this system is to develop the web application software to store and retrieve the 
student's marks. We are able to see the all the student’s marks in a organized way. Student IA 
marks management system has been designed to store and retrieve marks of all students mark 
in the educational institution in most efficient manner. Given the continuous rise in student 
population, tertiary institutions storing the student marks with the help of computer programs
makes it easy to organize and manage huge data. Storing student’s information and their 
academic record is very important. This application helps to the department staffs and 
students to know the marks in the internal assessment. This project is to be developed using 
HTML and CSS for Front end MySQL for Back end and JSP to connect these technologies
